# MITRE-ATT&CK

## OVERVIEW
MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a comprehensive framework developed by MITRE Corporation. It provides a detailed mapping of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries in cyberattacks. The framework is designed to help security teams understand how attackers operate, identify potential threats, and improve their defenses. Here's an overview of its key components:

## 1. Tactics
Tactics represent the why of an attack – the adversary's goal or objective. Each tactic corresponds to a high-level goal that the attacker tries to achieve during the attack lifecycle. MITRE ATT&CK includes several tactics, such as:
	• Initial Access: Gaining entry to a network.
	• Execution: Running malicious code on a target system.
	• Persistence: Ensuring continued access to the target system.
	• Privilege Escalation: Gaining higher-level privileges on the system.
	• Defense Evasion: Avoiding detection and staying under the radar.
	• Credential Access: Stealing login credentials.
	• Discovery: Mapping the network and understanding the environment.
	• Lateral Movement: Moving through the network to reach valuable targets.
	• Collection: Gathering data from the target.
	• Exfiltration: Stealing data from the network.
	• Impact: Disrupting operations or damaging the target.

## 2. Techniques
Techniques represent the how of an attack – the specific methods or tools that an attacker uses to achieve their goals. For example, under the "Initial Access" tactic, techniques might include:
	• Phishing: Sending malicious emails to trick users into providing sensitive information or executing malicious payloads.
	• Exploitation of Public-Facing Applications: Taking advantage of vulnerabilities in publicly accessible applications.

## 3. Sub-techniques
These are more granular descriptions of a technique, providing additional details on how an attacker might implement a specific technique. For example:
	• Spearphishing Attachment (under Phishing): Attacker sends a malicious attachment to gain access.
	• Spearphishing Link (under Phishing): Attacker sends a link that leads to a malicious website.

## 4. Procedures
Procedures are the actual methods used by attackers to carry out their tactics and techniques. They can involve specific malware or scripts, or even publicly available tools.

## 5. Use Cases
MITRE ATT&CK can be used by:
	• Red Teams: To simulate adversary behaviors and test defenses.
	• Blue Teams: To identify gaps in detection capabilities and improve defenses.
	• Threat Intelligence: To correlate adversary TTPs with observed activities.
	• Incident Response: To assist in understanding the attacker's approach and how to mitigate it.

## ATT&CK Matrix
The ATT&CK Matrix is the heart of the framework, organizing the tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques in a matrix format. It helps security teams visualize and assess the different attack methods adversaries might use and how to detect and defend against them.

## Conclusion
MITRE ATT&CK is a valuable resource for cybersecurity professionals to enhance threat detection, response, and defense strategies. It provides a common language for discussing and understanding cyber threats and helps organizations build more resilient security operations.
